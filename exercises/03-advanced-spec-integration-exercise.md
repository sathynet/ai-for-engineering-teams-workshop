# Exercise 03: Advanced Spec Integration

**Time:** 15 minutes
**Goal:** Create advanced integration specifications for complex dashboard features

## The Challenge

Use your specification writing skills to tackle complex dashboard integration features that require multiple components working together, demonstrating advanced spec-driven development.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Generate complex integration specification
- [ ] Document multi-component dependencies and data flow
- [ ] Define clear integration patterns and interfaces
- [ ] Create spec ready for advanced implementation techniques

## Your Tasks

### Part 1: Generate Advanced Integration Specs (10 minutes)

**Create all three complex dashboard integration specs:**

**Customer Health Monitoring Integration:**
```
Write a CustomerHealthMonitoring spec using @templates/spec-template.md and @requirements/health-score-calculator.md and @requirements/predictive-alerts.md
```

**Dashboard Orchestration System:**
```
Write a DashboardOrchestrator spec using @templates/spec-template.md and @requirements/production-ready-dashboard.md
```

**Predictive Customer Intelligence:**
```
Write a PredictiveIntelligence spec using @templates/spec-template.md and @requirements/predictive-alerts.md and @requirements/market-intelligence.md
```

### Part 2: Integration Validation (3 minutes)

**Review your integration spec:**
- Does it clearly define component dependencies?
- Are data flow patterns documented?
- Are error handling and edge cases covered?

### Part 3: Architecture Documentation (Extra Credit)

**Add architectural notes to your spec:**
```
Add a section to your spec titled "Integration Architecture" that includes:
- Component interaction diagram (in text/markdown)
- Data flow description
- Key integration points
- Dependencies on previously created specs
```

## Save Your Work

```
git add @specs/*.md && git commit -m "docs: add advanced Customer Intelligence Dashboard integration specifications"
```

## Expected Outcomes

- Advanced integration specification demonstrating complex multi-component features
- Understanding of architectural planning through specifications
- Experience with complex requirements transformation
- Foundation specifications ready for advanced implementation exercises

## Integration Concepts Learned

- **Multi-Component Orchestration** - Managing interactions between multiple components
- **Data Flow Architecture** - Planning how information moves through complex systems
- **Integration Point Definition** - Clearly specifying component interfaces
- **System-Level Thinking** - Understanding how individual specs combine into cohesive applications
