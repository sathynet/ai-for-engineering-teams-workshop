## Your Tasks

### Part 1: Create Component Generator Subagent (4 minutes)

**Step 1: Open the subagent creation interface**
```
/agents
```

**Step 2: Create a new project-level subagent:**
```
Name: dashboard-component-generator

Description: Customer Intelligence Dashboard component specialist. Creates React 19 + TypeScript components with Tailwind styling for customer data, health scores, and dashboard layouts. Specializes in Next.js App Router patterns, customer intelligence features, and health score displays.

Tools: Read, Write, Edit

Model: inherit
```

**This creates a subagent file at `.claude/agents/dashboard-component-generator.md`**

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

### Part 2: Generate CustomerCard Component (4 minutes)

**Ask your subagent to create the component:**
```
Use the dashboard-component-generator subagent to 
create a CustomerCard component at 
components/CustomerCard.tsx based on 
@requirements/customer-card.md
and @specs/customer-card-example.md
```

</div>

<div>

### Part 3: Review and Integration (2 minutes)

**Review the generated CustomerCard component:**
- Does it match the Customer Intelligence Dashboard design?
- Are health score colors implemented correctly?
- Is it ready for integration with CustomerSelector?
- Does it handle customer domains properly?

</div>

</div>
